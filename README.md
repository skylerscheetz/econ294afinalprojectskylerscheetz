# The intended topic for research for the final project involves the research question of what factors determine whether an individual spends at least one hour per day on average on the computer for leisure. The goal is to estimate a prediction. The potential data source comes from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, and it is contained in the America Time Use Survey (ATUS). I plan to answer this question by downloading the data from the most recent questionnaire, and focusing on the Computer Use for Leisure section of the survey. I am curious about the strongest determinants for whether an individual will have at least one hour of leisure time on the computer per day. For this reason, I want to create an indicator variable that the individual responded with having at least one hour per day of leisure time on the computer. To gain insight into the relationship between the determinants of computer use on leisure time on the computer, I plan to implement a logit model with lasso regularization and penalty obtained from 10-fold cross-validation. The optimal penalty will achieve the optimal complexity (number of regressors), and classification will be used to predict the actual outcome of the indicator for screen time past six hours per day. The OOS ROC curve will be utilized to find the optimal classification rule (cutoff) for sensitivity and specificity. This context is interesting because parents and guardians may want to have more information on the factors of computer use and leisure time on the computer for their children.
